When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate a work with other people and want to make your work access by the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you don't want the files in remote repo and want to test or experiment in your local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You use forks when you want to contribute someone work that you don't have permission on so you just forks repository to your own Github.
Clones use when you want to copy thr repository to your local repository including form Github to local or local to local.
Branches is the seperate version of the files use when eg. you want anather mode or test experimental, debugging version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can keep your master branch and continue working on, while you have the remote branch to keep track commit on Github or by other people and you can merge change whenever you want.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using files transfer like Google Drive or just use Facebook or maybe by usb drive.
Git and Github would be easier and not using it would be harder since git is a version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to test something that I didn't sure it will break the code like trying an experimental and don't want to mess the master branch up or you callaborate with other people
then use seperate branch is good too. Benefit from make changes directly in master would be fast than doing a seperate branch since you can use pull and push rightaway
but it will have some problems.
